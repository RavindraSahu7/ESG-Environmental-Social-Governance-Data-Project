## 🎯 Project Objective

To build an **interactive ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) data dashboard** that visualizes sustainability performance across countries.  
The goal was to uncover insights into global ESG indicators, enable comparisons between countries, and highlight trends in environmental, social, and governance factors.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project delivers a **data-driven ESG analysis** through a **Power BI dashboard** that allows users to:

- Visualize **ESG performance by country** using maps and charts.  
- Filter data dynamically by **Category** (Environment, Social, Governance) and **Indicator**.  
- Compare ESG values across multiple countries.  
- Understand performance distribution through color-coded **Performance Bands** (e.g., High, Medium, Low).  

> ⚠️ Note: The project was submitted under the title **“Data Governance and Security Dashboard”** for internship documentation, but it is fundamentally an ESG-focused analytics project.
